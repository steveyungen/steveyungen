Here are a few ways that you can update the text, photos, songs, and videos on the website. Just be careful not to delete or edit any of the other code outside of these areas or it could cause issues. 

It'll usually take 3-5 minutes for changes to show up on the website. 

### How to update text:
*Example: Updating About Steve text on Home Page.

1) Go to src -> pages
2) Open Home.js
3) Click the Pencil icon in the top right corner (Edit this Page)
4) Scroll down until you see the text
5) Edit it
6) Click Commit Changes at the bottom of the page

## How to add or remove songs:
*Example: Adding a new Hawaiian song called "Why Key Ki?" to the list. Song is hosted on SoundCloud. 

Intro: You'll need the slug to the song on SoundCloud. Get this by opening the track in SoundCloud. The slug is the part at the end of the url, after "https://soundcloud.com/steve-yungen/[SLUG]". It'll be all lowercase and hyphenated. You'll see all the other examples of slugs in the songs.js file. 

1) Go to src -> content 
2) Open songs.js
3) Click the Pencil icon in the top right corner (Edit this Page)
4) Add a new line to the object titled "hawaiian"
5) Add the new song *exactly* in this format:

  #### "Why Key Ki?": "why-key-ki",
  
*Note: Don't forget the quotation marks or the comma at the end.*

6) Click Commit Changes at the bottom of the page


To remove a song, simply delete it from the list.
